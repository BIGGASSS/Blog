I've tried many many ways to acheive the goal of making a blog site that fits my taste.

At first, I tried to code all the HTML, CSS, and potentially JavaScript all by myself.
Well, obviously it did not work for me. I was way too noob for that.

Then I heard about *WordPress*, and used it to create a blog easily.
Don't get me wrong, *WordPress* is very newbie-friendly and easy to work with.
I just think that it's way too heavy as a blog framework, especially when you have things like *Typecho* around.
